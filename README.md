# README — Motives for nicotine dependance and cessation among Iraqi college students (R)

**Repository authors:** Ghaith Al‑Gburi, Mustafa Al-Gburi

**Status:** _planned / not yet conducted._ The repository contains the analysis pipeline and results from testing that pipeline on simulated data.

## Purpose
This repository contains the R analysis code and supporting outputs prepared for a planned study examining the motives for nicotine dependence and cessation among undergraduate students in Iraq. Because the empirical study has not yet been conducted, the repository includes a set of simulation outputs used to validate scoring, psychometric checks, and modelling code.

The `Simulation results/` directory contains the outputs produced when the analysis pipeline was run on synthetic (simulated) datasets — including rendered HTML reports and auxiliary files (for example, item–item correlation matrices generated from data simulation).

> **Data privacy:** this repository does **not** include participant‑level identifiable data.
